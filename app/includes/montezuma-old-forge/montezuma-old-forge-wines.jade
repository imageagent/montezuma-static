            p These wines are specially labeled for our Old Forge location. The labels exhibit a feeling of the Adirondacks and Old Forge. Visited my tourist all year, the Adirondacks is a place for relaxation.
            p The Moose River series labels were created by artist Sandra Hildreth of Saranac Lake. Prints of the artwork are also being sold at our winery in Old Forge. The Camper's series labels were created by artist Wendy Barcus who was employed by Montezuma Winery and now lives in Tennessee.
